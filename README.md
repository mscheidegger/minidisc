# Minidisc
Zero-config service discovery for Tailscale networks

With minidisc, you can advertise and discover REST or gRPC services on your
Tailnet with zero configuration. There's no need to run a server either &mdash
minidisc-enabled services form a simple peer-to-peer network, so as long as a
a service is up, you can discover it.

## Status
This has gone through some internal testing, and it works, but it's still very
much a work in progress. If this looks useful to you, let me know!
